Welcome to the tutorial for Blockly on INGInious !
==================================================
      
This tutorial will walk you through the steps necessary to setup your own blockly course. It is split in two parts : 

* Maze type tasks. (TODO add hyperlinks) TODO add image of example
* Blocks type tasks. 

We recommend that you start with the Maze type task, as it is easier to modify to your needs. 

In this tutorial you'll learn about :

* The INGInious interface - What you and your students will need to know to navigate INGInious. 
* How to create and edit tasks.
* How to customize your own course.

This tutorial is available both in french and in english.
